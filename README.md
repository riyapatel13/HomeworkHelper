Homework Reminder App

This is an Android application that is an agenda for students. Some features of this app include a checklist of tasks that the user has added along with a location-based reminder that the user can set. For instance, if the user needs to remember to pick up milk while they are at the grocery store, then they can set a reminder for a specific time and place to pick up milk. The reminder will still pop up even if the app is running in the background or the phone is on sleep mode. In addition, if the user exits the app and re-enters, all the data will be saved, as well as the information about the reminders. Although this app was created for students in mind, it can be used for a variety of purposes.
